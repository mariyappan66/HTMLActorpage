    Vijay played for the masses and family audience. Vijay's ability dance well ensured his film has good song. He also did films which was appealing to family audience unlike Ajith whose big hits were gangster films and anti-hero films. Suriya and Vikram experimented a lot and poor script choices hurt their career.
